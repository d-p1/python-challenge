# python-challenge
For this challenge, we will create a script using Python that will analyze the data sets provided for both PyBank and PayPoll. 

By using the dataset, the Python script created 
will then be analyzed and calculated for the following values and create an output of the desired result
 

  -The total number of months included in the dataset

  -The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  -The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

  -The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  -The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
